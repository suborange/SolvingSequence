- scramble the cube first, then have all canvases start solving 

- can i use the mouse move thing, find the values of the mouse movement, and copy his camera swivel?

- maybe just make a file for each different canvas if nothing else works?
- need to redesign to show current scramble, 

- make a canvas and redesign the cube for clarity, with animations
- write the moves to a file, every 100 moves or something new line.

- when something is finished, snap to a camera that is fixed
