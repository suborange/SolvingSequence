# Init

# dev
- also maybe highlight the pi number it is at.

# HTML

# CSS
- static current displays. so they dont move around so often.

# JavaScript
- read the pi files in chunks. maybe just through streaming, can find the current starting chunk? (nah this is not efficient) 
    - maybe use await function? grab 10 numbers, complete the function awaiting for end, then grabs next ten numbers?
    - scrape data of web, to have newlines for each number? ( no thats like twice as big of a file)


- need a way to save all states of the rubiks cube incase it resets or fucks up, can restore the cube values, and continue on with the same pi digit. 
( add a starting position, and can compare? maybe starting distances from one another. )

- displaying number values needs to account for commas ( it might)


- mess with confetti numbers, make random? colors are the cube colors?

# P5 


# streamerbot
- setup to detect when stream is offline, add text file feature to pause everything ( is_solving=fasle). 
    - then start again when stream is detected to be up again? ( maybe update n read text file?every 2 seconds? is_solving = true) 

# later
- maybe a page on how it works and was built?
- link to how it was built?

## not sure if posssible
