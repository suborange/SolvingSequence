# Init
- wireframe the website for 4 quadrants, for each canvas
- make a quadrant for all the notation correctly aligned and designed to show each digit clearly. 


# HTML
- i think it us just one home page, maybe a page on how it works and was built?


# CSS
- find good color pallete and design in relation to rubiks cube. 


# JavaScript
- make a canvas and redesign the cube for clarity, with animations
- need a wya to check if solved, or parts of it being solved? 
( the matrix has another value corresponding to its correct order, then check if it is that order after every move)
- need a way to save all states of the rubiks cube incase it resets or fucks up, can restore the cube values, and continue on with the same pi digit.
