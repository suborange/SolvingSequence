## REMEMBER TO INTERACT WITH DOM ON START SO PLAY SOUND WORKS!
# Init
+ wireframe the website for 4 quadrants, for each canvas
+ make a quadrant for all the notation correctly aligned and designed to show each digit clearly. 

+ and then show all concurrent digits and moves ( which will be the same, against different scrambles)
d+ need to add another box below to show the current digits and moves

# HTML
+ i think it is just one home page, 
+ add notations + templates


# CSS
+ find good color pallete, design, font, borders, etc. in relation to rubiks cube. 

# JavaScript
+ maybe line up the move, camera reset, on move ending, so it looks less choppy?

+ add sound effect for each turn, make it?

# P5 
+ make new camera, to point at cube from an angle, and rotate around the cube showing 3 sides at all times, and thus all 6 around
